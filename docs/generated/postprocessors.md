## <span class="component">AdHocFairness</span>
<b class="parameters">Extends</b><br> *Postprocessor*<br><b class="parameters">About</b><br>
Adjusts node scores so that the sum of sensitive nodes is moved closer to the sum of non-sensitive ones based on 
ad hoc literature assumptions about how unfairness is propagated in graphs. The constructor initializes the fairness-aware postprocessor. 
<br><b class="parameters">Parameters</b>

 * *ranker:* The base ranking algorithm. 
 * *method:* The method with which to adjust weights. If "O" (default) an optimal gradual adjustment is performed [tsioutsiouliklis2020fairness]. If "B" node scores are weighted according to whether the nodes are sensitive, so that the sum of sensitive node scores becomes equal to the sum of non-sensitive node scores [tsioutsiouliklis2020fairness]. 
 * *eps:* A small value to consider rank redistribution to have converged. Default is 1.E-12.
## <span class="component">BoostedSeedOversampling</span>
<b class="parameters">Extends</b><br> *Postprocessor*<br><b class="parameters">About</b><br>
Iteratively performs seed oversampling and combines found ranks by weighting them with a Boosting scheme. The constructor initializes the class with a base ranker and the boosting scheme'personalization parameters. 
<br><b class="parameters">Parameters</b>

 * *ranker:* The base ranker instance. 
 * *objective:* Optional. Can be either "partial" (default) or "naive". 
 * *oversample_from_iteration:* Optional. Can be either "previous" (default) to oversample the ranks of the previous iteration or "original" to always ovesample the given personalization. 
 * *weight_convergence:* Optional.  A ConvergenceManager that helps determine whether the weights placed on boosting iterations have converged. If None (default), initialized with ConvergenceManager(error_type=pyrgank.MaxDifference, tol=0.001, max_iters=100) 

<b class="parameters">Example</b>
```python 
import pygrank as pg 
graph, seed_nodes = ... 
algorithm = pg.BoostedSeedOversampling(pg.PageRank(alpha=0.99)) 
ranks = algorithm.rank(graph, personalization={1 for v in seed_nodes}) 
```
## <span class="component">FairPersonalizer</span>
<b class="parameters">Extends</b><br> *Postprocessor*<br><b class="parameters">About</b><br>
A personalization editing scheme that aims to edit graph signal priors (i.e. personalization) to produce 
fairness-aware posteriors satisfying disparate impact constraints in terms of pRule. The constructor instantiates a personalization editing scheme that trains towards optimizing 
retain_rank_weight*error_type(original scores, editing-induced scores) 
+ pRule_weight*min(induced score pRule, target_pRule) 
<br><b class="parameters">Parameters</b>

 * *ranker:* The base ranking algorithm. 
 * *target_pRule:* Up to which value should pRule be improved. pRule values greater than this are not penalized further. 
 * *retain_rank_weight:* Can be used to penalize deviations from original posteriors due to editing. Use the default value 1 unless there is a specific reason to scale the error. Higher values correspond to tighter maintenance of original posteriors, but may not improve fairness as much. 
 * *pRule_weight:* Can be used to penalize low pRule values. Either use the default value 1 or, if you want to place most emphasis on pRule maximization (instead of trading-off between fairness and posterior preservation) 10 is a good empirical starting point. 
 * *error_type:* The supervised measure used to penalize deviations from original posterior scores. pygrank.KLDivergence (default) uses is used in [krasanakis2020prioredit]. pygrank.Error is used by the earlier [krasanakis2020fairconstr]. The latter does not induce fairness as well on average, but is sometimes better for specific graphs. 
 * *parameter_buckets:* How many sets of parameters to be used to . Default is 1. More parameters could be needed to to track, but running time scales **exponentially** to these (with base 4). 
 * *max_residual:* An upper limit on how much the original personalization is preserved, i.e. a fraction of it in the range [0, max_residual] is preserved. Default is 1 and is introduced by [krasanakis2020prioredit], but 0 can be used for exact replication of [krasanakis2020fairconstr]. 
 * *parity_type:* The type of fairness measure to be optimized. If "impact" (default) the pRule is optimized, if "TPR" or "TNR" the TPR and TNR parity between sensitive and non-sensitive nodes is optimized respectively, if "mistreatment" the AM of TPR and TNR parity is optimized. 

<b class="parameters">Example</b>
```python 
import pygrank as pg 
graph, personalization, sensitive, algorithm = ... # sensitive is a second graph signal 
algorithm = pg.FairPersonalizer(algorithm, .8, pRule_weight=10) # tries to force (weight 10) pRule to be at least 80% 
ranks = algorithm.rank(graph, personalization, sensitive=sensitive) 
```
Example (treats class imbalanace):

 * *ranker:* Optional. The base ranker instance. A Tautology() ranker is created if None (default) was specified. 
 * *expr:* Optional. A lambda expression to apply on each element. The transformer will automatically try to apply it on the backend array representation of the graph signal first, so prefer pygrank's backend functions for faster computations.
