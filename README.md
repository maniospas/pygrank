# :hammer_and_wrench: Installation
`pygrank` works with Python 3.9 or later. The latest version can be installed with pip per:

# :brain: Overview
Analyzing graph edges (links) between graph nodes can help 
rank or score nodes based on proximity to structural or 
attribute-based communities given known example members. 
With the introduction of graph signal processing and 
[decoupled graph neural networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442381.3449927),
the importance of node ranking has drastically increased,
as its ability to perform induction by quickly 
spreading node information through edges has 
been theoretically and experimentally corroborated. 
For example, it can be used to make predictions based on 
a few known node attributes or based on the outputs of 
feature-based machine learning models.

`pygrank` is a collection of node ranking algorithms 
and practices that support real-world conditions, 
such as large graphs and heterogeneous preprocessing 
and postprocessing requirements. Thus, it provides 
ready-to-use tools that simplify the deployment of 
theoretical advancements and testing of new algorithms.


Some of the library's advantages are:
1. **Compatibility** with [networkx](https://github.com/networkx/networkx), plain [numpy](https://numpy.org), [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org), [pytorch](https://pytorch.org), [matvec](https://github.com/maniospas/matvec).
2. **Datacentric** interfaces that do not require transformations to identifiers.
3. **Large** graph support with sparse data structures and scalable algorithms.
4. **Seamless** pipelines (e.g., operation [chains](docs/basics/functional.md)), from graph preprocessing up to benchmarking and evaluation.
5. **Modular** components to be combined and a functional chain interface for complex combinations.
6. **Fast** running time with highly optimized operations
